# InfinityLoop.sh  
_A script that ensures a process never stops._  

### What It Does:  
- **Runs indefinitely, regenerating itself if killed**  
- **Hides itself in system processes to avoid detection**  
- **Restarts automatically even after shutdown or reboot**  
- **Prevents manual termination, ensuring infinite execution**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A process that cannot be killed is a process that cannot fail."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Install InfinityLoop.sh on a system  
2. Start the infinite execution:  
   ```bash
   sudo bash InfinityLoop.sh --start
